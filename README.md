## Core Techniques

- **Applied `MVVM Design Pattern`**: Built a scalable code structure with clear separation between business logic and UI components for better maintainability and testability.
- **Implemented SwiftUI for Declarative UI**: Designed and built user interfaces with SwiftUI, creating a more interactive and dynamic experience across the app.
- **Firestore Integration**: Integrated Firebase Firestore to manage users' fridge contents, recipes, and grocery lists, ensuring `real-time data synchronization across devices`.
- **Push Notifications**: Implemented push notifications using `Firebase Cloud Messaging` to alert users when items in their fridge are about to expire.
- **Image Recognition**: Built an image recognition feature to allow users to take photos of ingredients, automatically identifying and adding them to their fridge or grocery list using `CoreML`.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Built a custom data fetching mechanism to minimize network requests, `reduce memory footprint`, and enhance app performance, especially when working with large recipe databases.
- **Widget Functionality**: `Implemented iOS widgets` to provide users with a glanceable view of their fridge contents and recipes.
- **Sign-in with Apple and Firebase Authentication**: Ensured a seamless and `privacy-friendly authentication flow`, allowing users to log in securely via Apple ID and Firebase Authentication.
- **Reusable UI Components**: Created `reusable SwiftUI components` such as recipe cards, fridge item rows, and alert modals for consistency across the app.
- **User-defined Notifications**: Allowed users to `customize alert settings` for item expiration reminders, ensuring they can take timely action to reduce food waste.
- **What to Eat Game**: Developed an interactive game feature where users spin a wheel to randomly select a meal type, making cooking decisions more fun and engaging.
-  **Trained and integrated OpenAPI responses** to enhance the app‚Äôs interactivity by fetching real-time data from external sources, improving recipe suggestions and user experience.
